    "# Introduction\n",
    "In this case study, we will explore how to tackle Kaggle Titanic competition using Python and Machine Learning. When the Titanic sank, $1502$ of the $2224$ passengers and crew were killed. One of the main reasons for this high level of casualties was the lack of lifeboats on this self-proclaimed __\"unsinkable\"__ ship. In this tutorial, we will learn how to apply machine learning techniques to predict a passenger's chance of surviving using Python.\n",

This means that no limit on the depth of the tree was set. This is not necessary a good thing, as we are likely overfitting. This means that while our model describes the training data extremely well, it doesn't generalize to new data, which is frankly the point of prediction. \n",

    "One of the most complicated aspects of Data Science is trying various machine learning algorithms, dealing with over and under-fitting and tweaking parameters to find the best possible fit to new and unseen data. Part of the process fo tweaking paramaters isfeature engineering. This is the process of creatively engineering our own features by combining the different existing variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "While feature engineering is a discipline in itself, too broad to be covered here in detail, we will have a look at a simple example by creating our very own new predictive attribute: `family_size`. A valid assumption is that larger families need more time to get together on a sinking ship, and hence have lower probability of surviving. Family size is determined by the variables `SibSp` and `Parch`, which indicate the number of family members a certain passenger is traveling with. So when doing feature engineering, we add a new variable `family_size`, which is the sum of `SibSp` and `Parch` plus one (for the observation itself), to the test and train set. To engineer this new feature, we do the following:\n",

    "# Prediction using Random Forest\n",
    "A detailed study of Random Forests is outside the scope of this tutorial. However, since it's an often used machine learning technique, we introduce a general overview in Python. The Random Forest technique handles the overfitting problem we saw with decision trees. It grows multiple (very deep) classification trees using the training set. At the time of prediction, each tree is used to come up with a prediction and every outcome is counted as a vote. For example, if we have trained $3$ trees with $2$ saying a passenger in the test set will survive and $1$ says he will not, the passenger will be classified as a survivor. This approach of overtraining trees, but having the majority's vote count as the actual classification decision, avoids overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Building a random forest in Python looks is very similar to building a decision tree, with three key differences.\n",
    "1. A different class is used.\n",
    "2. A new argument is necessary.\n",
    "3. The necessary library from `scikit-learn` must be imported.\n",
    "    - Use the `RandomForestClassifier()` class instead of the `DecisionTreeClassifier()` class.\n",
    "    - `n_estimators` needs to be set when using the `RandomForestClassifier()` class. This argument allows us to set the number of trees we wish to plant and average over.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following exampple shows us how to build a Random Forest Classifier by dowing the following:\n",
    "1. Build the random forest with `n_estimators` set to 100.\n",
    "2. Fit your random forest model with inputs features_forest and target.\n",

We can request the same attribute from the random forest as well and interpret the relevance of the included variables. Since the Random Forest aleviates the overfitting problem, it would be a good exercise to compare it to the Decision Tree model in some quick and easy way. For this, we can use the `.score()` method, which takes the features data and the target vector and computes mean accuracy of the model."

    "# Ensemble Methods\n",
    "In an prediction task, it is important try and test multiple algorithms to find the best possible fit. In most cases it is not necessary or possible to test every single algorithm type against the data, a fare assesment may suffice, but it is a good practice to at least try achieve a better fit. That is why we introduced a different Machine Learning algorithm to the `DecisionTreeClassifier()` we were currently using. What we did in essence is introduce an Ensemble Method. The goal of ensemble methods is to combine the predictions of several base estimators built with a given learning algorithm in order to improve generalizability or robustness over a single estimator. In our case, we used the `RandomForestClassifier()` which built several (very deep) classification trees that when used for prediction, each tree is used to come up with a prediction and every outcome is counted as a vote. This is an example of an __averaging methods__. Here, the driving principle is to build several estimators independently and then to average their predictions. On average, the combined estimator is usually better than any of the single base estimator because its variance is reduced. This is evedent when comparing the score from both models above.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the biggest issues with ensemble Methods is that they can be computationally exhaustive. The alternative is manually trying every possible variable combinations (since there is no easy way to know which parameters work best, other than trying out many different combinations) or parameter combinations (hyperparameters) to get the best model fit. Fortunately, the `scikit-learn` package includes the `GridSearchCV` and `RandomizedSearchCV` functions wich allows for the evaluation of each parameter setting independently, in parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "The down-side to this is the fact that this is not scalable. The models above are executed on data in Pandas DataFrames. These DataFrames are memory resident, so unless the machine executing the models has sufficient memory or the data sets are small enough, the `GridSearchCV` and `RandomizedSearchCV` functions may not be helpful. Fortunately the team at Databrix has released the [`spark-sklearn`](http://spark-packages.org/package/databricks/spark-sklearn) package to allow us to execute these funcitons over a Spark cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following example is based on the  [Auto-scaling scikit-learn with Spark](https://databricks.com/blog/2016/02/08/auto-scaling-scikit-learn-with-spark.html) example, but has been adapted to our Titanic example. The objective is to populate a \"grid\" of various model parameters and have `GridSearchCV` execute each set of parameters to determine the best score. The goal here is not necessarily to find a model with a better score but to illustrate the time it takes to search through the various model parameters to find the best one. The example has the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Import the `GridSearchCV` library from `scikit-learn`.\n",
    "2. Create the function to report the top $3$ models, courtesy of [Databrix](http://go.databricks.com/hubfs/notebooks/Samples/Miscellaneous/blog_post_cv.html).\n",
    "3. Create the \"grid\" of parameters combnations to execute. Thjis is loosley based on the Databrix example.\n",
